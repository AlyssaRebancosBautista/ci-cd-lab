# Reflection

1. Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository and automatically testing them to catch errors early. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) is the process of automatically preparing or releasing the software to production after it has passed the necessary checks, ensuring quick and reliable updates.

2. Automation reduces human error, saves time, and makes development more efficient. By automating repetitive tasks like testing, building, and deploying, developers can focus on solving problems and writing new features rather than manually managing processes.

3. CI/CD pipelines make sure everyone’s work is integrated and tested consistently, which improves collaboration and reduces conflicts in code. Automated checks guarantee that bugs are found earlier, making the final product more reliable. It also creates transparency across the team since everyone can see the status of the project at any time.

4. Some challenges included configuring the pipeline correctly, ensuring all dependencies were installed, and fixing issues related to environment differences. It also required understanding how the CI/CD tool integrates with the repository and making sure the pipeline steps matched the project’s needs.
